## Ordering and Payment

We accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and bank transfers. All payments are processed securely through encrypted payment gateways.

### Q7: Can I modify or cancel my order?
Orders can be modified or canceled within 1 hour of placement, provided they haven't entered the fulfillment process. Contact customer support immediately if you need to make changes. Once an order is being prepared for shipment, modifications may not be possible.

### Q8: Do you offer payment plans or financing?
Yes, we partner with several financing companies to offer flexible payment options. During checkout, select "Financing Options" to see available plans. Approval is typically instant, and you can spread payments over 3, 6, or 12 months.

### Q9: Why was my payment declined?
Payment declines can happen for several reasons: insufficient funds, incorrect billing information, security holds by your bank, or exceeded credit limits. Double-check your information and try again. Contact your bank if the problem persists.

### Q10: Can I use multiple payment methods for one order?
Currently, we only accept one payment method per order. If you need to split payment across multiple cards or methods, you'll need to place separate orders.

## Products and Inventory

### Q11: How do I know if an item is in stock?
Product availability is shown on each product page. Items show as "In Stock," "Limited Quantity," or "Out of Stock." Inventory is updated in real-time, but high-demand items may sell out quickly.

### Q12: Can I reserve an item while I decide?
We don't offer item reservations, but you can add items to your cart and they'll be held for 30 minutes. After that, items return to general inventory to ensure fair access for all customers.

### Q13: Do you restock out-of-stock items?
Most items are restocked regularly. You can sign up for restock notifications on the product page. We'll email you when the item becomes available again. Popular items typically restock within 2-4 weeks.

### Q14: Are your product descriptions accurate?
We strive for 100% accuracy in our product descriptions, images, and specifications. If you receive an item that doesn't match the description, contact us immediately for a full refund or exchange.

### Q15: Can I see more photos of a product?
Most products have multiple photos showing different angles and details. Look for thumbnail images below the main photo that you can click to enlarge. Some products also have 360-degree views or video demonstrations.
